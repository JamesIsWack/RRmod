# Project Q&A
Q. What is the goal of this project?
<br>
A. To learn. And since it uses Lua, perhaps a port to other devices, such as PC.
<br>
Q. Whats Rock Revolution?
<br>
A. Rock Revolution is a music video game developed by ZoÃ« Mode and HB Studios and published by Konami. The game was released on 15 October 2008 for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. (Wikipedia)
<br>
Q. Whats a "RRmod"
<br>
A. RR is short for "Rock Revolution. The "mod" part is there to match my other project, [WoRmod](https://github.com/JamesIsWack/WoRmod).
<br>
Q. What engine does Rock Revolution use?
<br>
A. Its a custom engine most likely, but it seems to use Lua for a lot of its logic and data, as well as XML and INI.
<br>
Q. What version of Lua is the game using?
<br>
A. `Lua 5.0.3` if IDA isn't lying.
<br>
Q. Who are you?
<br>
A. Im a software developer, noob reverse engineer, and game modder. My primary focus in game modding and RE is to learn, and to create (hopefully) useful mods for old games. I mostly focus on Playstation 3 releases and rhythm games.
